# OSCHACK

## My solution for the OSC Hack is to cater toward Dino Luzzy Energy, it consists of redesigning the whole UI for the website and adding functionality like a navbar for quick website traversal, hover effect to make the website come to live, interactive features such are contact form submission popup notification, and complete responsive UI to make sure users get a great experience in any device. Additionally, I implement a chatbot component that utilizes Chatgtp API to create a personal assistant when a customer visits the website to make them feel welcome.

## To start the React app:

Navigate to the React app directory:

''' cd app '''
''' npm install '''

### Start the React app:

''' npm start '''


## Flask Server
To start the Flask server:

### Navigate to the server directory:

''' cd server '''
### Install dependencies (make sure to include them):

''' pip install flask flask_cors python-dotenv openai '''

### Run the Flask server:

''' python app.py '''
This will start the Flask server on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## Note:
Make sure to set up your OpenAI API key by creating a .env file in the server directory and 
### adding your API key as follows:

.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

### Replace your_api_key_here with your actual OpenAI API key.

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and configurations set up to run both the React app and the Flask server successfully.
